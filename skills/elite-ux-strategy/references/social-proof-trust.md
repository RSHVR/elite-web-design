## Social Proof Types

### Hierarchy of Effectiveness

From strongest to weakest impact:

```
1. Video testimonials (39% higher conversion)
2. Detailed case studies with metrics
3. Named testimonials with photos
4. Real-time activity notifications (18% lift)
5. Star ratings with review counts
6. Client/publication logos
7. User counts ("Join 50,000+")
8. Generic social proof
```

### Video Testimonials

**Why they work:**
- Hardest to fake
- Emotional connection
- Body language builds trust
- 39% conversion boost vs text-only

**Best practices:**
```
Structure:
1. Who they are (relatability)
2. Problem they had (identification)
3. Why they chose you (validation)
4. Specific results (proof)
5. Recommendation (endorsement)

Format:
- 60-90 seconds optimal
- Good audio quality (critical)
- Natural setting > polished studio
- Include captions (85% watch muted)
```

**Placement:**
- Near major CTAs
- Landing page mid-section
- Pricing page
- Checkout flow

### Written Testimonials

**Anatomy of a strong testimonial:**
```
"[Specific result/outcome]. [What they tried before].
[Why this product was different]. [Emotional impact]."

— [Full Name], [Title], [Company]
   [Photo] [Optional: Logo]
```

**Example:**
```
"We increased our conversion rate by 47% in 3 months.
We'd tried 4 other tools that promised similar results
but [Product] was the only one that actually delivered.
Our team finally trusts our data."

— Sarah Chen, Head of Growth, TechCorp
   [Headshot] [TechCorp logo]
```

**What makes testimonials weak:**
- Anonymous ("A satisfied customer")
- Vague praise ("Great product!")
- No specific outcome
- No photo or identity
- Too polished/corporate

### Real-Time Activity

**Types:**
```
Purchase notifications:
"John from Texas just purchased..."

Visitor counts:
"47 people viewing this right now"

Recent signups:
"Sarah just started her free trial"

Activity feeds:
"Last order placed 3 minutes ago"
```

**Effectiveness:** 18% average conversion lift

**Best practices:**
- Must be real (fake = destroys trust)
- Don't overdo frequency (annoying)
- Include location for relatability
- First name only (privacy)

### Star Ratings

**Format:**
```
★★★★★ 4.8/5 from 2,847 reviews

### Logo Walls

**Best practices:**
```
Structure:
"Trusted by [category] at"
[Logo 1] [Logo 2] [Logo 3] [Logo 4] [Logo 5]

Tips:
- 5-8 logos optimal (not overwhelming)
- Recognize at glance (brand awareness)
- Similar size/visual weight
- Grayscale often cleaner
- Link to case studies if available
```

```
