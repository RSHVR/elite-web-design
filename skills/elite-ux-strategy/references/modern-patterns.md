### Market Growth

```
- $290B market projected by 2025

- 25% more spend when using chat
```

### Patterns

**Live chat for conversion:**
```
Placement:

Best practices:
- Proactive triggers (time on page, exit intent)
- Quick responses (< 30 seconds ideal)
- Human + AI hybrid
- Business hours transparency
```

**Chatbot for qualification:**
```
Use cases:
- Lead qualification
- Product recommendations
- FAQ handling
- Scheduling

Flow:
1. Greeting + qualification question
2. Route based on response
3. Collect contact info
4. Hand off to human or next step
```

**Conversational landing pages:**
```
Replace forms with conversation:
"Hi! What brings you here today?"
→ [Option A] [Option B] [Option C]
→ Follow-up based on selection
→ Personalized recommendation
→ Capture info naturally
```

### Chat Commerce

```
Emerging:
- Purchase within chat (ChatGPT + Shopify)

## Product-Led Growth

### PLG Metrics

```
Key metrics:
- Time to value: Target < 5 minutes
- Activation rate: First meaningful action
- PQL conversion: 25-30% (vs 5-10% MQL)
- NRR: 120%+ (expansion revenue)
```

### PLG Patterns

**Freemium strategies:**
```
What's changing:
- Unlimited free declining
- Strategic feature gating
- Usage-based limits
- Time-limited full access

Example (not "free forever"):
- Free: Core features, 1 user, limited usage
- Paid: Unlocks collaboration, higher limits
```

**Reverse trials:**
```
Pattern:
1. Start with premium features
2. Show value of advanced features
3. Downgrade if no payment
4. User feels loss (powerful motivator)

Why it works:
- Loss aversion
- Experienced value before paying
- No "wondering what you're missing"
```

**Product-qualified leads:**
```
PQL signals:
- Used core feature X times
- Invited team members
- Reached usage threshold
- Explored premium features
- Spent X time in product

PQL → 25-30% conversion
(vs MQL → 5-10%)
```

### Self-Serve Onboarding

```
Best practices:
- "Aha moment" in < 5 minutes
- Progressive complexity
- Contextual education
- Celebrate milestones
- Clear next steps

Onboarding checklist pattern:
□ Complete profile (easy)
□ Create first [item] (core value)
□ Invite a teammate (expansion)
□ Connect integration (stickiness)
```

## Zero-Party Data

### Why It Matters

```
Context:
- Third-party cookies dying

```

**Quiz examples:**
```
E-commerce:
"Find your perfect skincare routine"
→ Skin type, concerns, preferences
→ Personalized product recommendations

SaaS:
"What's your growth score?"

→ Customized solution recommendation

Service:
"Which [service] is right for you?"
→ Needs assessment
→ Package recommendation
```

## Viral Mechanics

K > 1 = organic growth
K < 1 = need paid acquisition

Example:
- Average user invites 5 people

```

### Referral Program Design

**Double-sided rewards:**
```
Best practice:

"Unlock feature for both"
```
