## Copywriting Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

The classic direct response formula.

```
PROBLEM: Identify the pain
"Tired of spending hours on spreadsheets?"

AGITATE: Twist the knife
"While you're drowning in data, your competitors
are making decisions and moving ahead."

SOLUTION: Present relief
"[Product] automates your reporting so you can
focus on strategy, not spreadsheets."
```

**When to use:** Landing pages, email, ads, anywhere you need to create urgency.

### PASTOR (Extended PAS)

More depth for longer-form copy.

```
PROBLEM: Identify the pain
"Manual reporting is killing your productivity."

AMPLIFY: Consequences
"Every hour spent on reports is an hour not spent
on growth. That's $X in lost opportunity every week."

STORY: Relatable example
"Sarah was spending 15 hours a week on reports.
Her team was frustrated, her boss was impatient..."

TRANSFORMATION: The change
"Now she generates reports in one click.
She got promoted. Her team respects her more."

OFFER: Your solution
"[Product] gives you the same transformation.
One-click reporting, real-time dashboards, AI insights."

RESPONSE: Clear CTA
"Start your free trial today. No credit card required."
```

### Before-After-Bridge

Simple and visual.

```
BEFORE: Paint the current state
"You're manually tracking leads in spreadsheets,
missing follow-ups, losing deals."

AFTER: Show the desired state
"Every lead tracked automatically, perfect timing
on every follow-up, 40% more deals closed."

BRIDGE: How to get there
"[Product] is the bridge. Set up in 5 minutes,
see results by end of week."
```

### Feature-Advantage-Benefit (FAB)

Turn features into compelling copy.

```
FEATURE: What it is
"AI-powered lead scoring"

ADVANTAGE: What it does
"Automatically ranks leads by likelihood to convert"

BENEFIT: Why it matters
"Focus on the leads that will actually buy,
stop wasting time on dead ends"

Full FAB statement:
"Our AI-powered lead scoring (feature) automatically
ranks leads by likelihood to convert (advantage),
so you focus on buyers and stop wasting time (benefit)."
```

**FAB Examples:**

| Feature | Advantage | Benefit |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Real-time sync | Always up-to-date | Never work with old data |
| One-click export | Reports in seconds | More time for strategy |
| Mobile app | Access anywhere | Work from anywhere |
| 256-bit encryption | Bank-level security | Your data is safe |
| 24/7 support | Help when you need it | Never stuck alone |

## Awareness Levels

Eugene Schwartz's 5 levels determine how to approach copy.

### Level 1: Unaware

**They don't know they have a problem.**

```
Strategy: Interrupt with relatable content
- "Are you making these 5 marketing mistakes?"
- Lead with content, not product
- Education-first approach
```

### Level 2: Problem-Aware

**They know the problem, not the solutions.**

```
Strategy: Agitate the problem, hint at solutions
- "Struggling with [problem]? You're not alone."
- Focus on pain points and consequences
- Introduce category of solutions
```

### Level 3: Solution-Aware

**They know solutions exist, not your product.**

```
Strategy: Position your approach as best
- "There's a better way to [solve problem]"
- Compare approaches (not competitors directly)
- Differentiate your methodology
```

### Level 4: Product-Aware

**They know your product, not convinced yet.**

```
Strategy: Overcome objections, build trust
- Social proof and case studies
- Feature/benefit deep dives
- Address specific concerns
- Comparisons with alternatives
```

### Level 5: Most Aware

**They're ready, just need the push.**

```
Strategy: Make it easy, add urgency
- Strong CTAs
- Limited-time offers
- Risk reversal (guarantees)
- Clear next steps
```

### Copy by Awareness Level

| Level | Headline Focus | CTA Style |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Unaware | Curiosity, questions | "Learn more" |
| Problem-aware | Pain point | "See how" |
| Solution-aware | Approach/method | "Discover" |
| Product-aware | Benefits, proof | "Try free" |
| Most aware | Offer, urgency | "Buy now" |

## CTAs

```

**First-person:**
```

```

| Interest | "Watch demo", "Take the tour" |
| Desire | "Start free trial", "See pricing" |
| Action | "Get started", "Buy now", "Subscribe" |

### CTA Context Patterns

**Primary CTA (high commitment):**
```
Prominent button, contrasting color
"Start free trial"
"Get started now"
"Buy [Product]"
```

**Secondary CTA (lower commitment):**
```
Text link or ghost button
"See pricing"
"Watch demo"
"Learn more"
```

**Tertiary CTA (minimal):**
```
Plain text link
"Contact sales"
"Read documentation"
"View case studies"
```

### CTA Placement

```
Above fold: Primary CTA visible
After value prop: Reinforce CTA
After features: "Ready to try?"
After testimonials: Social proof → CTA
Footer: Final CTA for scrollers
Sticky: Mobile bottom bar or header
```

## Value Propositions

### Value Prop Formula

```
[End result] + [Specific benefit] + [Differentiator]

"Grow your email list 3x faster
with AI-powered popups that don't annoy visitors"
```

### Value Prop Components

```
1. What you offer (clear, simple)
2. Who it's for (target audience)
3. Key benefit (outcome-focused)
4. Differentiator (why you, not alternatives)
```

### Value Prop Examples

**SaaS:**
```
Weak: "Project management software"
Strong: "Ship projects 2x faster with the tool
        remote teams actually enjoy using"
```

**E-commerce:**
```
Weak: "Quality shoes online"
Strong: "Premium leather shoes that get
        more comfortable with every wear.
        Free returns if you're not obsessed."
```

**Service:**
```
Weak: "Marketing agency services"
Strong: "We've helped 200+ SaaS companies
        double their MRR. You could be next."
```

### Clarity Test

Your value prop should answer:
1. What do you offer?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why should I care?
4. Why you vs alternatives?

If any answer is unclear, rewrite.

## Copy Testing

### What to Test

**High impact:**
- Headlines (biggest impact usually)
- CTA copy
- Value proposition
- Social proof presentation
- Form field labels

**Medium impact:**
- Subheadlines
- Button colors (with copy changes)
- Testimonial selection
- Benefit ordering

**Lower impact:**
- Body copy tweaks
- Image selection
- Minor wording changes

### Copy Testing Best Practices

```
1. Test one element at a time
2. Ensure statistical significance
3. Test big changes first
4. Run tests for full business cycles
5. Document learnings
```

### Copy Swipe File

Keep a collection of:
- Headlines that caught your attention
- CTAs that made you click
- Emails that you actually read
- Landing pages that converted you

Analyze why they worked, adapt (don't copy).
