## Interest Stage

**Goal:** Build curiosity. Answer "what does it do?"

### Feature/Benefit Presentation

**Features tell, benefits sell:**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| "AI-powered analytics" | "Know exactly what's working without digging through data" |
| "Real-time sync" | "Your team is always on the same page" |
| "One-click export" | "Reports ready in seconds, not hours" |

"Connect your data"      →     "Set your goals"        →     "Watch growth happen"
[Supporting visual]            [Supporting visual]            [Supporting visual]
[One-line explanation]        [One-line explanation]         [One-line explanation]
```

### Interest Stage Patterns

**Bento grid features:**
- Visual variety maintains attention
- Different sizes signal hierarchy
- Interactive elements reward exploration

**Scroll-triggered reveals:**
- Progressive disclosure maintains interest
- Animation draws eye to new content
- Pacing prevents overwhelm

**Interactive demos:**
- Let users experience value
- No commitment required
- "Aha moment" before signup

---

## Desire Stage

**Goal:** Create want. Build trust and emotional connection.

### Social Proof Placement

```
Position social proof:
1. Near CTAs (reduces friction)
2. After feature sections (validates claims)
3. Before pricing (justifies value)
4. In checkout (reduces abandonment)
```

### Testimonial Hierarchy

**Most effective:**
```
1. Video testimonials from similar users
   - Highest trust, hardest to fake
   - Show real results with specifics

2. Case studies with metrics
   - "Company X increased revenue 47% in 3 months"
   - Include before/after

3. Named testimonials with photos/titles
   - Real name, real company, real face
   - Specific outcome mentioned

4. Star ratings with review count
   - "4.8/5 from 2,847 reviews"
   - Link to full reviews

5. Logo walls
   - Recognizable brands build credibility
   - "Trusted by" framing
```

**Avoid:**
- Anonymous quotes
- Generic praise without specifics
- Testimonials that could apply to anything

### Emotional Triggers

**Transformation narrative:**
```
Before: [Pain state]
"Spending hours on manual data entry"

After: [Desired state]
"Focus on strategy while automation handles the rest"

Bridge: [Your solution]
"[Product] automates the tedious stuff"
```

**FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):**
```
- Real-time activity ("X people viewing this")
- Social proof numbers ("Join 50,000+")
- Limited availability (when genuine)
- Competitor comparison ("While you wait, competitors...")
```

---

## Action Stage

**Goal:** Remove friction. Make conversion effortless.

### CTA Optimization

**Copy formulas:**
```
Action + Outcome:
"Start growing" > "Sign up"
"Get my free trial" > "Free trial"
"See it in action" > "Demo"

Risk reversal:
"Start free trial - no credit card"
"Get instant access - cancel anytime"
```

**Visual hierarchy:**
```
Primary CTA: High contrast, prominent
Secondary CTA: Lower contrast, supporting
Tertiary: Text link, minimal emphasis
```

### Form Optimization

**Field reduction:**
```
Every field you remove increases conversion.

High friction fields (avoid if possible):
- Phone number (unless calling)
- Company size
- "How did you hear about us?"
- CAPTCHA (use invisible reCAPTCHA)

Minimum viable form:
- Email only (if possible)
- Name + email (most common)
- Add fields progressively post-signup
```

**Form UX patterns:**
```
- Inline validation (immediate feedback)
- Smart defaults (pre-fill when possible)
- Progress indicators (for multi-step)
- Error messages that help (not blame)
- Autofocus on first field
```

### Reducing Abandonment

**Exit-intent triggers:**
```
Ethical exit-intent:
- Offer to save progress
- Provide help/chat
- Show social proof reminder
- Reduce commitment (email only)

Avoid:
- Desperate discounts
- Manipulative copy
- Blocking exit entirely
```

### Trust Signals at Conversion

```
Near payment/signup, include:
- Security badges
- Money-back guarantee
- "Cancel anytime" messaging
- Support availability
- Privacy assurance
- What happens next (expectation setting)
```

---

## Retention Stage

**Goal:** Deliver value. Create habits.

### Onboarding Patterns

**Progressive onboarding:**
```
Day 0: Core value quickly
- Get to "aha moment" fast
- Celebrate first success
- Set expectations

Day 1-7: Build habits
- Daily engagement hooks
- Guided feature discovery
- Progress celebration

Day 8-30: Deepen engagement
- Advanced features
- Community introduction
- Success milestones
```

**Empty state design:**
```
Empty states are onboarding opportunities:
- Show what's possible
- Provide clear next action
- Include example content
- Make it feel welcoming, not empty
```

### Habit Formation

**Hook Model (Nir Eyal):**
```
1. Trigger (external/internal)
   - Email notification
   - Daily routine
   - Emotional state

2. Action (simple behavior)
   - Open app
   - Check dashboard
   - Complete task

3. Variable reward
   - New insights
   - Progress acknowledgment
   - Social feedback

4. Investment
   - Add data
   - Customize settings
   - Invite team
```

### Reducing Churn

**Churn signals to watch:**
```
- Declining login frequency
- Feature non-adoption
- Support tickets increasing
- Payment failures
- Negative feedback
```

**Intervention patterns:**
```
- Re-engagement emails
- Feature discovery prompts
- Success manager outreach (high-value)
- Win-back offers (last resort)
```

---

## Referral Stage

**Goal:** Turn users into advocates.

### Viral Mechanics

**Viral coefficient (K):**
```
K = invites sent × conversion rate

K > 1 = organic growth
K < 1 = need paid acquisition

Example:
- Average user invites 5 people
- 20% convert
- K = 5 × 0.2 = 1.0 (sustainable)
```

### Referral Program Design

**Double-sided rewards:**
```
Best structure:
- Referrer gets: [Value that drives referral]
- Referee gets: [Value that drives signup]

Examples:
- Both get $20 credit
- Both get extra month free
- Both get premium feature access
```

**Referral UX:**
```
Make it easy:
1. One-click share options
2. Pre-written messages
3. Unique referral links
4. Progress tracking
5. Reward visibility
```

### Organic Virality

**Built-in shareability:**
```
- Public profiles/pages (backlinks)
- Shareable outputs (reports, designs)
- Collaborative features (team invites)
- Social integrations ("Share to Twitter")
- Badges/achievements (brag-worthy)
```

**User-generated content:**
```
- Encourage reviews/testimonials
- Feature user stories
- Create community spaces
- Host user events/webinars
- Build template/resource libraries
```
