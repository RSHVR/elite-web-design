## How to Study Inspiration

### Don't Copy, Understand

When studying award-winning sites:

1. **Identify the technique** - What animation/layout is used?
2. **Understand the purpose** - Why this technique? What does it communicate?
3. **Analyze timing** - Note easing, duration, stagger patterns
4. **Map to implementation** - How would you build it?
5. **Adapt to context** - How does it fit your project?

### Questions to Ask

- What makes this feel premium?
- How does animation support content?
- What's the hierarchy of movement?
- How does it handle mobile?
- What accessibility considerations exist?
