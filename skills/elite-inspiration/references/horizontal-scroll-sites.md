## Implementation Reference

Based on patterns from these sites:

### Basic Structure
```javascript
// Common to most sites
gsap.to('.track', {
  x: () => -(trackWidth - windowWidth),
  ease: 'none',
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: '.container',
    pin: true,
    scrub: 1,
    end: () => `+=${trackWidth}`
  }
});
```

### Parallax Within Horizontal
```javascript
// Used by Locomotive, Lusion
gsap.to('.section-bg', {
  x: -100,
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: '.section',
    containerAnimation: scrollTween,  // Link to main horizontal
    scrub: true
  }
});
```

### Progress Indicator
```javascript
// Common pattern
ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: '.container',
  onUpdate: self => {
    progressBar.style.transform = `scaleX(${self.progress})`;
  }
});
```

## Questions to Ask

When studying these sites:

1. How long is each section visible?
2. What triggers the content animations within sections?
3. How does the nav/header behave?
4. What's the scroll-to-pixel ratio?
5. How do they handle browser resize?
6. What's the mobile experience?
